JSON Lint (EXTENDED)
=========

A modified version of the JavaScript [JSON parser](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint/) by Z. Carter.

Try a **demo** for the modified JSON parser [jsonlint-ext](https://russaa.github.io/jsonlint-ext/):
the demo page uses the _location information_ for marking JSON errors in an editor;
in addition you can (manually) try the extended options of the JSON verifier, e.g. with/without
`strict` mode (see details below).


MODIFICATION (russa)
----

Modified JSON parser with:
 * [additional location information](#mod-location-information) (i.e. position of objects within parsed string)
 * [`strict` parsing mode](#mod-strict-parsing-mode) which
   * will throw an error if JSON object has duplicate keys
   * _TODO: add features for strict parsing mode(?)_ 

-----

### MOD: Location Information 

The parser returns position information for parsed JSON objects, i.e.
the location for JSON properties and values within the input-string that is parsed.


_Location information_ - i.e. the position, where a data-property is located 
within the String - may be useful, if you code a JSON editor and want to
annotate data-properties; and then show/indicate which properties have annotations 
in your editor.
Another example would be, if you want to define a data format that puts 
additional constraints on the JSON data.
Then you could write a verifier which uses the _location information_ in case
one of these additional restrictions was not satisfied in order to show,
where exactly in the data the "misbehavior" occurred.



Enable extraction of position information:
```javascript

var jsonlint = require("jsonlint");

//enable meta-data extraction (i.e. the location information):
jsonlint.setLocEnabled(true);

var data = jsonlint.parse('{"creative?": false}');

```

the result for example above would be:
```javascript

// Index (in 3 lines)
//
//  2 4 6 8 10 13 16 19
// 1|3|5|7|9|11|14|17|20
// |||||||||||12|15|18|
// {"creative?": false}
//
// extracted meta data:
{
  "creative?": false,
  "_loc": {
    ///// location for whole object itself
    "first_line": 1,
    "last_line": 1,
    "first_column": 1,
    "last_column": 19,
    ///// location for property "creative?" in parent object
    "_creative?": [
      {//// position of property/name
        "first_line": 1,
        "last_line": 1,
        "first_column": 1,
        "last_column": 12
      },
      {//// position of property/value
        "first_line": 1,
        "last_line": 1,
        "first_column": 14,
        "last_column": 19
      }
    ],
    "_this": {///// location for object itself
      "first_line": 1,
      "last_line": 1,
      "first_column": 1,
      "last_column": 19
    }
  }
}
``` 

##### The loc Object

Each position/location information object consists of the following properties:
```javascript
{ 
  "first_line"   : NUMBER
  "last_line"    : NUMBER 
  "first_column" : NUMBER
  "last_column"  : NUMBER
}
```

##### loc for Properties

Generally, the position information is stored in property `"_loc"`.

Positions for **properties** are noted in the object's `"_loc"`-property
within sub-property: `"_" + <property-name>`.

For a property, the location information is an array with 2 location-entries: 
the first entry _locates_ the property-name and the second one the property-value

Note: if the value does not have a primitive type, then the value-entry will actually be not
 a `loc` information object, but contain itself the value's location information via sub-properties;
 in this case, the `loc` for the value-object itself will be contained in the special sub-property `"_this"`. 
See the additional information below: `loc` for [Arrays and Objects](loc-for-arrays-and-objects) and
`loc` for [Arrays Entries](loc-for-array-entries).


For example, the result for `{"someProperty":...}` would look something like:
```javascript
{
  "someProperty":
  ...
  "_loc": {
    "_someProperty": [
      {"first_line":...},  //location of the property-name for someProperty
      {"first_line":...}   //location of a primitive property-value for someProperty
    ]
    ...
```

##### loc for Arrays and Objects

The object's / array's own position is noted in `"_loc"` in sub-property `"_this"`
e.g.:
```javascript
{
  "_loc": {
    "_this": { "first_line": ...
````

##### loc for Array Entries

Positions for array entries are noted in the array's `"_loc"` in sub-property: `"_" + <entry-index>`
e.g.:
```javascript
{
  "_loc": {
    "_0": { "first_line": ...
    "_1": { "first_line": ... 
            ...
```

-----

### MOD: Strict parsing mode

Enable `strict` parsing mode:
```javascript

var jsonlint = require("jsonlint");

//enable meta-data extraction (i.e. the location information):
jsonlint.setStrict(true);

//OK
var data = jsonlint.parse('{"creative?": false}');

//ERROR
jsonlint.parse('{"duplicate": false, "duplicate": true}');

```

If `setLocEnabled` is set to `true`, the error will contain additional location
information (see also [loc properties](#the-loc-properties) above):
 * `_loc`: position of the offending property 
 * `_locTo`: position of the first declaration of the property

Example for error with additional location information:
```javascript
...
jsonlint.setLocEnabled(true);
try{
  jsonlint.parse('{\n  "duplicate": false,\n  "duplicate": true\n}');
} catch (e){
  console.log('duplicate property at line '+e._loc.first_line);
  console.log('property was already defined at line '+e._locTo.first_line);
}
```
